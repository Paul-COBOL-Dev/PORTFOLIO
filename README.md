1.System Definition:

  This repository demonstrates how to modernize a legacy insurance workflow using COBOL, JCL, and DB2, with Modern COBOL development in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). 
  The system implemented in this project is referred to as the **Field Service System (FSS)**.


2.Project Overview:

 (1) This project focuses on the **new policy onboarding process** in **Individual Health Insurance** and explains, step by step, how a manual and paper-driven workflow can be automated and computerized. 
 (2) To support the scenario, the **business operations**, **FSS development schedule**, and an **end-to-end walkthrough** are defined as a simulated case. 
 (3) The **stakeholders**, **participating departments**, **development team structure (headcount and roles)**, and the **budget** are also defined as fictional assumptions for the purpose of this project.

3.Technology Stack:
  COBOL, CICS, JCL, DB2 / Query, IPFS, VS code, Jason, Modern COBOL

4.Notes: 
  All schedules, resources, and budgets described in this project are fictional and are used solely for demonstration purposes.
